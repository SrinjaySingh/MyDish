RED VELVET CAKE

Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, red-brown, crimson or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered 
with ermine icing. Traditional recipes do not use food coloring, with the red color due to non-Dutched, 
anthocyanin-rich cocoa. Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, vinegar, and flour.
Red velvet goes well with white chocolate cream cheese, cannoli filling, cookies and cream and buttercream.
Red velvet is made with cocoa powder, vinegar and buttermilk. The chemical reaction between these ingredients 
help give the cake a deep maroon color that is often enhanced by extra food coloring.
